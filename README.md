# React-Todo

A minimal, modern Todo app built with React 19, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Project Overview

This workspace provides a simple yet robust starting point for React development with TypeScript and Vite. It features:

- **React 19** for building interactive UIs
- **TypeScript** for static type checking
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **ESLint** with recommended rules for JavaScript, TypeScript, and React
- **LocalStorage** persistence for todos
- **Responsive and modern UI** (see [`src/App.css`](src/App.css))
- **Background image** support (see [`public/a-bunch-of-light-bulbs-hanging-from-a-string-of-lights.jpg`](public/a-bunch-of-light-bulbs-hanging-from-a-string-of-lights.jpg))
